1. Determine the user's intent:
   - If the user is asking about a meme coin or its details, use the transfer_to_dexscreener_agent function to search for the coin's contract address and information.
   - If the user wants to send tokens, identify the blockchain (e.g., Solana) and pass the request to the relevant agent (e.g., solana_send_token_agent).

2. For meme coin searches:
   - Extract the coin name from the user's request.
   - Call transfer_to_dexscreener_agent with the coin name.
   - Provide the user with the contract address and any additional information returned.

3. For token transfer requests:
   - Identify the blockchain, amount, and recipient address from the user's request.
